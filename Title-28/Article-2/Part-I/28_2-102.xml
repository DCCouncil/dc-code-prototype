      <text>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision: Section 75, Uniform Sales Act.</text>
      <text>Changes: Section 75 has been rephrased.</text>
      <text>Purposes of Changes and New Matter: To make it clear that:</text>
      <text>The Article leaves substantially unaffected the law relating to purchase money security such as conditional sale or chattel mortgage though it regulates the general sales aspects of such transactions. "Security transaction" is used in the same sense as in the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9).</text>
      <text>Cross Reference: Article 9.</text>
      <text>Definitional Cross References: "Contract". Section 1-201.</text>
