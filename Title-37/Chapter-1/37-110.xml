  <text>In the event that a market vendor violates any law, regulation, sidewalk market rule or condition of the market vendor’s sub-lease as specified in the contract, the market manager may issue a market violation notice (“MVN”) to the market vendor suspending the market vendor’s sub-lease until the violation has been cured or corrected. If 3 MVNs are issued to a market vendor during the contract year, the market vendor’s sub-lease shall be cancelled. If the market manager decides not to renew a market vendor’s sub-lease, the market manager shall give the market vendor written notice on or before January 31. MVNs, cancellation, and any decision not to renew a market vendor’s sub-lease shall be effective immediately but may be appealed to the Department of General Services.</text>
