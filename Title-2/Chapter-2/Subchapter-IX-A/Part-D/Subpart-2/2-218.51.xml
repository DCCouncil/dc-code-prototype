  <level>
    <num>(a)</num>
    <text>The subcontracting requirements of § 2-218.46 may be waived only if there is insufficient market capacity for the goods or services that comprise the project and such lack of capacity leaves the contractor commercially incapable of achieving the subcontracting requirements at a project level. The subcontracting requirements of § 2-218.46 may only be waived in writing by the Director. An agency seeking waiver of the subcontracting requirements of § 2-218.46 shall submit to the Director a request for waiver, which shall include the following:</text>

      <text>A summary of the market research or outreach conducted to analyze the relevant market; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(3)</num>
      <text>The consideration given to alternate methods for acquiring the work to be subcontracted in order to make the work more amenable to being performed by certified business enterprises.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>(a-1)</num>
    <text>Before the Director approves an agency’s waiver request, the Director shall:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(1)</num>
      <text>Send an electronic notice to all certified business enterprises notifying them of the agency’s waiver request; and</text>

      <text>Post a copy of the agency’s waiver request on the Department’s website, or such other locations as the Department may establish, for 10 days to provide the public reasonable notice of the waiver request.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>

      <heading>Effect of amendments</heading>
      <text>D.C. Law 16-191 validated a previously made technical correction.</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 17-20 repealed subsec. (c); and, in subsec. (d)(2), substituted “Director” for “Commission”. Prior to repeal, subsec. (c) read as follows: “(c) The Commission may find that a waiver of the subcontracting requirements of §§ 2-218.46 and 2-218.50 for a particular contract are justified in order to achieve the purposes of this subchapter.”</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 17-207, in subsec. (e), substituted “certified” for “small, local, or disadvantaged”.</text>
      <text>The 2014 amendment by D.C. Law 20-108 rewrote the section.</text>
      <text>The 2015 amendment by D.C. Law 20-234 added (a-1); and deleted the last sentence in (b), which read “A copy of the Director’s determination shall be posted to the Department’s website or such other locations as the Department may establish for 5 days such that the public shall have reasonable access to the determination before the Director grants any waiver.”</text>
