      <text>Effectiveness and expiration of D.C. Law 16-98: Section 4 of D.C. Law 16-98 required that "this act shall take effect subject to the inclusion of its fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan; provided, that this act shall expire on October 1, 2006 if its fiscal effect has not been included in an approved budget and financial plan or in the Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Request Act of 2006."</text>
